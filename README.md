# How to Use
1. Copy and paste the prompt into ChatGPT.

3. Hit enter and wait for ChatGPT to output your case! In some cases, you'll have to tell it to "continue."

4. pip install objectionpy

5. Copy and paste the output from ChatGPT into the phoenixGPT Python script.

6. Run the code.

7. Sometimes, there will be errors. They're usually quite easy to solve. The error messages are quite descriptive.

8. In the same directory that you ran the code in, there should now be a file called scene.objection.

9. Go to objection.lol and load your scene.

10. Sometimes, there are a few broken frames within the scene. If that's the case, copy the text from that frame, delete the frame, and create it manually.
